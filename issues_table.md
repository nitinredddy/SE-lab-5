| Issue Type | Tool | Line(s) | Description | Fix |
|-------------|------|----------|--------------|-----|
| Mutable default argument | **Pylint (W0102)** | 8 | `logs=[]` was used as a default parameter; this creates a shared list across calls | Changed default to `None` and initialized inside the function |
| Bare `except:` block | **Pylint (W0702)** / **Bandit (B110)** | 19 | Generic exception handling (`try/except/pass`) hides real errors | Replaced with `except Exception as e:` and added a proper error message |
| Use of `eval()` | **Bandit (B307)** | 59 | `eval()` executes arbitrary code — high-risk security issue | Removed the `eval()` line entirely |
| File handling issues | **Pylint (W1514, R1732)** | 26, 32 | Used `open()` without `encoding` or context manager | Replaced with `with open(..., encoding="utf-8")` |
| Invalid naming convention | **Pylint (C0103)** | Multiple | Function names not in snake_case | Renamed to `add_item`, `remove_item`, `get_qty`, etc. |
| Missing function docstrings | **Pylint (C0116)** | Multiple | Functions lacked descriptive docstrings | Added concise docstrings for all functions |
| Unused imports | **Flake8 (F401)** / **Pylint (W0611)** | 2, 3 | `logging` and `ast` were imported but never used | Removed unused imports |
| Missing blank lines between functions | **Flake8 (E302, E305)** | Multiple | Functions not separated by 2 blank lines | Added required blank lines per PEP 8 |
| Line too long | **Flake8 (E501)** | 15 | Line exceeded 79 characters | Broke the long string into two lines |
| Missing module docstring | **Pylint (C0114)** | 1 | No description at top of file | Added a one-line module docstring at the top |
| Global statement | **Pylint (W0603)** | 42 | Use of `global stock_data` | Kept (necessary for this small script) but acknowledged as a design limitation |
